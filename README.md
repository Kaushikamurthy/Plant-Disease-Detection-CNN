# **Plant Disease Detection from Images**  

### **Objective**  
Develop a **Streamlit-based web app** that allows users to **upload plant leaf images** and predicts **plant diseases** using a **CNN model**. The application is designed to be **user-friendly for farmers**, with **regional language support** for accessibility.  

### **Key Features**  
- **User-Friendly UI**: Upload images, get real-time disease classification with confidence scores.  
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation for better accuracy.  
- **CNN Model**: Trained on the **New Plant Diseases Dataset (Kaggle)**, optimized with **transfer learning** and compared against **pre-trained models**.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensures **low latency** for real-time predictions.  
- **Deployment**: Fully accessible **Streamlit web app**, rigorously tested for reliability.  

### **Technologies Used**  
**Python, Streamlit, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, CNN**  

### **Deliverables**  
- **Web App** for disease detection  
- **Well-documented Codebase**  
- **Trained Models**  
- **Project Report & User Guide**  

This project applies **CNNs to real-world agriculture**, offering **farmers an automated, multilingual plant disease detection tool**.
